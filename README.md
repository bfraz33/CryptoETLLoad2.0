This is the first project I have attempted. I have created an ETL pipeline, written in python, that pulls data from CoinMarketCap API and places this into a CSV, followed by loading it into PostgreSQL. 
I have attached this data to Power BI and put the script on a task scheduler to update prices every 5min.
